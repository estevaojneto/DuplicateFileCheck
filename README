(This Python script was made mostly as a test algorithm. Use at your own risk!)

This is a quite simple and straightforward Python script that checks all files in a given folder and moves them to a user-inputted output folder. It is quite fast; by using a hash table, we can quickly verify if a file already exists in the folder. The logic here is simple: if a file's MD5 hash is present on the hash table (aka a collision), it means that it is duplicated. Then we add that file's name to another list, and move all files to somewhere else.

It is not recursive; meaning, it won't search subdirectories for repeating files. At least not for now. ;)
This script is cross-platform, it should work on pretty much any system that can run Python (and its OS library). 

For those who don't have Python installed, I offer an executable EXE. You're welcome. :)
