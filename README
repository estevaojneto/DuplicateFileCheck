(This Python script was made mostly as a test algorithm. Use at your own risk!)

This is a quite simple and straightforward Python script that checks for repeated files in a given folder and moves them to a user-inputted output folder. It is quite fast; by using a hash table, we can quickly verify if a file already exists in the folder. The logic here is simple: if a file's MD5 hash is present on the hash table (aka a collision), it means that it is duplicated. Then we add that file's name to another list, and move all files to somewhere else. (MD5 hashing the files is still a slow process though, there's nothing to be done about that)

Some things to note:
-It is not recursive; meaning, it won't search subdirectories for repeating files. At least not for now. ;)
-This script is cross-platform, it should work on pretty much any system that can run Python (and its OS library). 
-The script treats the most common exceptions, such as when a file can't be moved for whatever reason (when it's in use, for example) or if the output folder cannot be created (normally, an issue with permissions: try running it with sudo or "Run as administrator).

For those who don't have Python installed, I offer an executable EXE. You're welcome. :)
